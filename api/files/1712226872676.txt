<p>React is known as React because it primarily revolves around the concept of reactive programming. Reactive programming is a paradigm that deals with asynchronous data streams and the propagation of changes.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>When React was first introduced by Facebook in 2013, it aimed to provide a more efficient way to build user interfaces by enabling developers to create interactive and dynamic UI components that react to changes in data.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The name "React" reflects the core principle of the library, which is to efficiently update the user interface in response to changes in application state or data. Instead of imperatively manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model) to update the UI, React allows developers to declaratively describe how the UI should look at any given point in time, and it automatically handles the process of efficiently updating the DOM when the underlying data changes.</p><p><br></p><p>So, in essence, React is named so because it enables developers to build user interfaces that react to changes in data, following the principles of reactive programming.</p>
